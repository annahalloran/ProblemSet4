- Brief project description: The Wake Forest Jeopardy Game is a computer program designed to emulate the iconic TV game show, 
Jeopardy, with a theme centered around Wake Forest University. The program allows two players to engage in a competitive trivia game, 
taking turns to select and answer questions of varying difficulty levels for different point values. The objective is to accumulate the 
highest score by correctly answering questions across different categories until the entire game board is cleared.
      Custom Wake Forest Theme: The game features Wake Forest University-specific categories, questions, and visual elements to create an immersive experience for players familiar with the institution.
      Two-Player Mode: Players can compete against each other in a turn-based format, allowing for head-to-head competition.
      Question Database: The program incorporates a diverse database of trivia questions spanning various subjects and difficulty levels, tailored to suit players of different knowledge backgrounds.
      Point System: Questions are assigned different point values based on their difficulty level, with higher points awarded for more challenging questions.
      Interactive Game Board: Players interact with a virtual game board, selecting categories and point values to reveal trivia questions.
      Question Answering Mechanism: Players input their answers using a text-based interface, and the program evaluates the correctness of their responses.
      Score Tracking: The program keeps track of each player's score throughout the game, updating it after each correct answer.
      Game Progression: The game progresses as players continue to select and answer questions until all categories are exhausted, or until a predetermined end condition is met.
      Win Condition: The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.
      User-Friendly Interface: The program features an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
– Instructions: The computer prompts the first user to pick their category out of 5 Wake-themed information, and then also prompts the
user to pick their question level (100, 200, 300, 400) based on how challenging the question is. The program then checks if the user has
entered the right letter answer choice and awards them that amount of points, or 0 points for an incorrect answer. 
– Breakdown of effort/contributions: Both group members worked equally on all parts of this project, including formulating the categories, types of questions, and actual coding. Both group
members met with a CS tutor to ask questions they had and get a better understanding of how to format the code to get the program to run optimally.
